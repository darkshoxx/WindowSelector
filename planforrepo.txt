Want the following logic:
X boot program, probably with graphical interface
X button load previous data from config file?
X button alternative 1 "select all game windows"
    X MULTI-SELECTION
    X make list of all previously selected game windows
        X make user confirm sublist
        X option to repeat (too many games)
    X scrollbar
    I checkbox for pre-filtering
    X refresh
    X searchbar
- make wrapper around destroy function to add ABORT
X button alternative 2 "search active processes for names"
    X find current active window
    X add to list when changes
    X ignore itself
X confirm final game list
I option: choose ordering for cycle-button
    I choose button for cycle for and back
X option: choose individual button for each window.
    X choose button/combination for each window.
- store in config file! (In case of crashes NOT for repeats, because of changing PIDs)
X run, with status window of log of current and previous selections
    I button to show key mapping
